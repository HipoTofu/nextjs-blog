          My first impression for the first month of the semester so far.
          First week is all about orientation of the class. Second week 
          is more on the first module and I am liking it so far. I am 
          excited to implement codes into machinces or arduinos because
          I have always thought to myself "how do I put this code in a
          machines". I am excited to what me and my classmate are going 
          to make in our future thesis with these lessons.
        </p>

          I am excited to learn more in this semester.

          Now I know how to update a webpage.
