    Manifesto For Agile Software Development

        <p>
          We are uncovering better ways of developing
          software by doing it and helping others do it.
          Through this work we have come to value:
        </p>
        <p>
          Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
          Working software over comprehensive documentation
            Costumer collaboration over contract negotiation
              Responding to change over following a plan
        </p>
        <p>
          That is, while there is value in the items on
          the right, we value the items on the left more.
        </p>
        <p>
